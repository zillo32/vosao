  * Visit [www.vosao.org](http://www.vosao.org/) to learn more about installing and using the latest public release (RC1).

  * Visit [staging.vosao.org](http://staging.vosao.org) for the work-in-progress on the next release (RC2).

Vosao CMS is a collaborative open source project. All project development take places through this Google Code project site. New features and fixes are discussed and first documented through the issue tracker. To keep abreast with development, simply stay current with updates to the project site.

**You do not need to be a developer to use Vosao CMS.** Upon request, our volunteers will install the latest stable version to a new appspot site. Once installed, the entire site can be managed through a web browser.

The Vosao project was started in August 2009 in order to develop an open source tool for free site hosting on Google App Engine.
